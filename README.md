# Problem Domain: Meteorology. 
Meteorology is the science that explores Earth's atmosphere, delving into the mechanisms behind weather and climate. Weather apps offer users details about the present weather, forecasts, and a range of weather-related information like temperature, humidity, rainfall, wind speed, and more. All in all, weather apps are dependent of meteorology.

# What kind of app are we thinking?
We are thinking of developing a weather app. One that uses open weather map as an API and extrapolates datata to predict the forcasts for 7 days of the week.
