# Problem Domain: Travelling. 
The Travel Route Planner is a software application designed to assist users in finding the shortest or most efficient route to visit multiple locations on a map. This application will take a list of user-defined spots or waypoints and calculate the optimal route to visit all of them, minimizing distance or travel time.

# Specification
Functional Requirements

**_1. User Authentication (Optional)_**

Users can create accounts or log in using existing credentials to save their routes and preferences (optional).

**_2. Input Spots_**

Users can input a list of spots (points of interest) they want to visit on the map.
Each spot should have a name, geographical coordinates (latitude and longitude), and an optional description.

**_3. Route Calculation_**

The application will calculate the optimal route to visit all the input spots based on user preferences, such as shortest distance or quickest time.


**_4. Route Output_**

The application will provide the following information:
A map displaying the optimized route with markers for each spot.
A list of the spots in the optimized order.
Total distance or estimated travel time for the route.
Turn-by-turn directions between each spot.


_**5. Save and Share Routes**_

Users can save their optimized routes for future reference.
Users can share routes with others via a unique link or export route data in common formats (e.g., GPX).

Non-Functional Requirements

**_1.User-Friendly Interface_**

The application should have an intuitive and user-friendly interface for inputting spots and viewing the optimized route.

**_2. Performance_**

The route calculation should be efficient and provide results in a reasonable time, even for a large number of spots.

**_3. Map Integration_**

The application should integrate with a mapping service (e.g., Google Maps, Mapbox) to display maps and directions.
